Create custom dashboards for firewall health and security events

2.6 Testing and Optimization

Conduct thorough testing of all firewall rules
Perform penetration testing against the firewall
Optimize rules for performance and security

Phase 3: Antivirus and Anti-malware Deployment (Duration: 2 weeks)
3.1 Solution Selection

Evaluate enterprise antivirus solutions (e.g., Symantec, McAfee, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint)
Select a solution based on features, performance, and integration capabilities

3.2 Infrastructure Setup

Set up central management server for the chosen solution
Configure database backend for storing scan results and policies
Integrate with Active Directory for user and computer management

3.3 Policy Creation

Develop scanning policies for different device types (servers, workstations, laptops)
Configure real-time protection settings
Set up scheduled full-system scans

3.4 Deployment

Create deployment packages for different OS versions
Use Group Policy or SCCM for mass deployment of antivirus clients
Manually install on critical servers and test systems

3.5 Configuration and Tuning

Set up automatic definition updates
Configure quarantine policies
Implement application whitelisting for sensitive systems

3.6 Monitoring and Reporting

Set up email alerts for detected threats
Create weekly reports on scan results and system health
Integrate antivirus logs with SIEM solution

Phase 4: Security Audits and Vulnerability Assessments (Duration: 3 weeks)
4.1 Audit Planning
